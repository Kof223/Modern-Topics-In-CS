1. Open PSet7.mat to load the data
2. Call the methods ie. P1(VarName9, VarName5, VarName3)
First one should always be VarName9 because that's the classification.
VarName5 and VarName3 are the ones I used, but it should work for any of the others. 
If any other data are used, the axis titles may be wrong
